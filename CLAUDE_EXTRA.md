### File uploads

- generate upload URL in mutation (`ctx.storage.generateUploadUrl()`)
- POST from client
- store ID (take `v.id("_storage")`)
- serve with `ctx.storage.getUrl(fileId)` in queries

## TanStack Router

- Avoid `const search = useSearch()` - use `select` option instead
- Route params update quirks - preserve location when updating
- Search params as filters: validate with zod schema in route definition
- Navigate programmatically: `const navigate = useNavigate()` then `navigate({ to: '/path' })`
- Type-safe links: always use `<Link to="/path">` not `<a href>`
- Nested routes require parent to have `<Outlet />`, use `.index.tsx` files to show content at parent paths

## TanStack Query + Convex Integration

- Use `convexQuery()` from `@convex-dev/react-query` to create query options: `const queryOptions = convexQuery(api.module.function, { status: "active" })`
- Preload in route loaders: `loader: async ({ context: { queryClient } }) => await queryClient.ensureQueryData(queryOptions)`
- Use `useSuspenseQuery` in components: `const { data } = useSuspenseQuery(queryOptions)`
- For mutations, continue using Convex's `useMutation` directly
- **When adding auth to a query** (`ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()`), update its loader: `if ((window as any).Clerk?.session) await queryClient.ensureQueryData(authQuery)` - otherwise the app crashes on page refresh
